puniner_DESC;The pantheon of the Twelvegods is the most common and most influential religion in all of Aventuria, guiding spiritual life in almost the whole Middenrealm. It evolved out of a mixture of the gods and beliefs of settlers from the Gyldenland and native Aventurian peoples, particularly Tulamids. The pantheon in it's modern form was codified when, out of the chaos of the religious conflicts of the Dark Ages, emperor Silem-Horas decreed his famous edict named after himself in the year 98 before Bosparan's Fall. A pillar of support in all of life's hardships for the believer while acknowledging a great number of smaller cults as demigods allied to the true gods, the Twelve have been a force for good and peace throughout most of history. The twelve gods and their aspects are: \n §MPraios§! – Alveran's sovereign, God of sun, law and nobility\n §MRondra§! – Goddess of battle and honour\n §MEfferd§! – God of the seas and storms\n §MTravia§! – Goddess of family, home and hospitality\n §MBoron§! – God of death, sleep and dreams\n §MHesinde§! – Goddess of science and magic\n §MFirun§! – God of winter and hunt\n §MTsa§! – Goddess of peace, birth and fertility\n §MPhex§! – God of luck, trade and thievery\n §MPeraine§! – Goddess of agriculture and medicine\n §MIngerimm§! – God of smithing and craftsmanship\n §MRahja§! – Goddess of love, wine and music;The pantheon of the Twelvegods is the most common and most influential religion in all of Aventuria, guiding spiritual life in almost the whole Middenrealm.

This includes a higher regard for Horas of course, but also a more tolerant approach to magic and those that wield it.

Fearing for their lives, the people of Al'Anfa fled into the arms of the Nemekathean sect who try to divine Boron's will through dreams and intoxication and see ritualized suicide as a way of becoming one with Boron.

Disciples of Nandus are not overly altruistic however, should a learner prove too ignorant for their wisdom they will quickly move on to the next.

The son of Rahja was, according to legend, desired by all women he set eyes upon, except for Satuaria who taunted him. So one night, Levthan subdued her with the help of an enchanted tie given to him by Hesinde and conquered Satuaria. But she took her revenge on him when she turned Levthan into a common ram, cursed to spend his days on a dry meadow, feeding of fierce herbs. It is said Satuaria later often rued her curse for she was filled equally with love and hate for her conqueror. But every once in a while Levthan manages to shake off his curse for a night, spending it in a wild ecstatic round dance with those devoted to Satuaria. Some suggest Levthan has long abandoned everything holy and is now a follower of Rahja's wicked adversary Belkelel.

rastullah_DESC;The belief in Rastullah is a monotheistic religion usually found in and around the desert Khôm. After Rastullah had created Ethra and all the beings living on it and even time itself, he rested for 7 days – an eon in human time. When he awoke, he found that only one people had remained true to him, the tribe of the Beni Novad. He revealed himself to them in the oasis of Keft in the year 760 after Bosparan's Fall and gave them 99 laws so that they would not stray from their path. While many of these laws are ambiguous enough to provoke long and heated discussions between two Rastullah believers, they are united in their fight against the damnable god lizard.;The belief in Rastullah is a monotheistic religion usually found in and around the desert Khôm.

Upon their coming of age, the tribes under Ykkandil's control send their young men to him to prove themselves worthy. Should the dragon find them loyal to him, they return a respected member of their tribe, otherwise they are never seen again. Similarly, escaped slaves that wish to join the tribe are usually sent to see the dragon – few return.;Near the city of Mirham, Anoiha tribes worship the giant lindworm Ykkandil. The cunning dragon is over 1.800 years old and is slowly expanding his circle of faithfuls. Upon their coming of age, the tribes under Ykkandil's control send their young men to him to prove themselves worthy. Should the dragon find them loyal to him, they return a respected member of their tribe, otherwise they are never seen again. Similarly, escaped slaves that wish to join the tribe are usually sent to see the dragon – few return.;;;;;;;;;;;x

utulu_DESC;Most tribes of the Utulu tell legends that long ago, they lived in Obaran's empire of the sun. But due to the paradisical nature of their ancestor's lands they grew careless, which allowed the Nightblack Mistress, ruler of the dark sea, to pull the Utulu down into her dark realm. Once their ancestors managed to flee, they realized they could not face Obaran again and so, in shame, they turned their backs on his empire and fled across the sea to Aventuria.;Most tribes of the Utulu tell legends that long ago, they lived in Obaran's empire of the sun.

ferkina_DESC;The cult of Raschtula and Rascha is found among the Ferkina tribes of Aventuria, most often along the mountains surrounding the desert Khôm. While the gods are powerful, they are not inherently good or bad. Therefore, they represent the give and take of life, life and death, violence and lust. Raschtula, god of violence and power, lord of sun and death incites battle and war wherever he roams and finds particular enjoyment in the wrothful and those quick to lose their temper. Rascha, his wife, is the goddess of wild lust and fury that is honoured by debaucherous orgies. This wild and ruthless belief leads to the Ferkina looking down on those that call themselves civilized. These Bloodless are only good for robbing, killing or kidnapping at best.;The cult of Raschtula and Rascha is found among the Ferkina tribes of Aventuria, most often along the mountains surrounding the desert Khôm.
